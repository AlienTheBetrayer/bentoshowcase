## 🧠 Engineering Principles
This project is developed with a focus on clarity, modularity, and responsiveness. State is managed cleanly through predictable data structures, rendering work is isolated for performance, and interactions are built to feel intuitive and lightweight. The goal is to maintain a system that is easy to extend while ensuring consistent and fluid behavior across all user scenarios.

## 📸 Project Overview

### 1. Bento Grid
![Bento Grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlienTheBetrayer/bentoshowcase/refs/heads/main/readme/preview2.png)
A fully interactive 3D Bento grid built with a structured architectural approach. Each block is rendered in real-time, responds to user input, and forms the core spatial layout of the interface.

### 2. Grid Selection
